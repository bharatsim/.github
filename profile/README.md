|----|--------------------------------------------------------|

[BharatSim](https://bharatsim.ashoka.edu.in) is an open-source collaborative project that was initially developed through a collaboration between [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in) and [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), funded by the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/). The ongoing development of BharatSim at Ashoka University is funded by [Mphasis](https://www.mphasis.com/). BharatSim provides a distributed, multi-scale, simulation framework for agent-based models. It was originally designed to model the epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, including the social determinants of disease. BharatSim is easily extended to describe other communicable as well as non-communicable diseases. In addition to disease modelling, it may be used to study a wide range of social phenomena.

This organization brings together the main repositories used to develop, build, test, and use BharatSim:

- **[BharatSim](https://github.com/bharatsim/BharatSim)** contains the source-code for the BharatSim simulation engine. Documentation on how to download and use BharatSim is available [here](https://bharatsim.readthedocs.io). This repository also serves as a hub for raising issues about using the simulation engine.
- **[BharatSim-Visualisation](https://github.com/bharatsim/BharatSim-Visualisation)** contains the source-code for the BharatSim visualisation engine. This repository also serves as a hub for raising issues about using the visualisation engine.
- **[documentation](https://github.com/bharatsim/documentation)** contains the source-code for the BharatSim documentation, hosted on ReadTheDocs [here](https://bharatsim.readthedocs.io). If you wish to contribute to the documentation, please read the _Contributing_ section of the [`README.md`](https://github.com/bharatsim/documentation#readme) file. 
-  **[bharatsim.github.io](https://github.com/bharatsim/bharatsim.github.io)** contains the sources of the BharatSim [website](https://bharatsim.ashoka.edu.in).
-  **[bharatsim-showcase](https://github.com/bharatsim/bharatsim-showcase)** contains the source-code for models described in the paper _BharatSim: An agent-based modelling framework for India_.
