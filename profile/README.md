|----|--------------------------------------------------------|

[BharatSim](https://bharatsim.ashoka.edu.in) is an open-source collaborative project between [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in) and [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), funded by the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) and [Mphasis](https://www.mphasis.com/). BharatSim provides a distributed, multi-scale, simulation framework for agent-based models. It was originally designed to model the epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, including the social determinants of disease. BharatSim is easily extended to describe other communicable as well as non-communicable diseases. In addition to disease modelling, it may be used to study a wide range of social phenomena.

This organization brings together the main repositories used to develop, build, test, and use BharatSim:

- **[bharatsim-public](https://github.com/bharatsim/bharatsim-public)**: contains the source-code for the BharatSim project. A documentation on how to download and use BharatSim is available [here](https://bharatsim.readthedocs.io). This repository also serves as a hub for raising issues about using BharatSim. 
-  **[bharatsim.github.io](https://github.com/bharatsim/bharatsim.github.io)**: contains the sources of BharatSim's website and serves as a hub for raising issues about BharatSim's website and documentation.
